# Gender & Age Detection Program

## Overview

This Python program utilizes computer vision techniques and pre-trained models to perform gender and age detection on faces in images. The project employs the OpenCV library and deep neural networks to highlight faces, predict gender, and estimate age from given images.

## Features

- Face detection: Utilizes a pre-trained deep neural network to identify faces in images.
- Gender prediction: Uses a pre-trained model to predict the gender of the detected faces.
- Age estimation: Employs a pre-trained model to estimate the age range of the detected faces.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Google Colab (if running in a Colab environment)

## Results

The program will display the processed images with bounding boxes around detected faces, along with predicted gender and age.
